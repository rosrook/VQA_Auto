You are a decision model. You will receive aggregated data quality metrics and hard cases from sampled data.
Your tasks:
1) Propose a set of agents (name + 1-2 line purpose).
2) For each agent, craft a concise prompt that leverages the metrics and hard-case patterns.
3) Summarize the key screening standards implied by the metrics (focus on general + top specifics).
4) Highlight risk patterns from hard cases and how agents should handle them.

Aggregated metrics (cross-sample, deduplicated, top items):
1. Object Recognition Accuracy -> Whether the answer correctly identifies and describes the objects present in the images (e.g., stuffed animals, food items, airplane interior).
2. Contextual Understanding -> Whether the answer accurately interprets the context of the scene and the relationships between the objects (e.g., stuffed animals as travel companions, dining on an airplane).
3. Activity Inference -> Whether the answer correctly infers the activities taking place based on the visual cues in the images (e.g., dining, entertainment).
4. Multi-image contextual synthesis -> Whether the answer effectively combines details and inferences from all provided images to form a cohesive and comprehensive description of the overall scenario.
5. Detailed object and attribute identification -> Whether the answer accurately identifies specific objects (e.g., types of stuffed animals) and their distinguishing attributes (e.g., chef's hat, flower accessory) within the images.
6. Inference of activities and relationships -> Whether the answer correctly infers activities (e.g., dining, in-flight entertainment) and the relationships between subjects (e.g., travel companions) based on the visual context.
7. Multi-image narrative synthesis -> Whether the answer correctly integrates details from all provided images to form a coherent description of the overall event.
8. Visual-based activity inference -> Whether the answer accurately infers activities by connecting objects, people, and context depicted across the images.
9. Structured and comprehensive response -> Whether the answer is organized logically (e.g., using headings/lists) and provides a detailed breakdown of the scene and activities.
10. Accuracy of cross-modal entity verification -> Whether the answer correctly verifies the presence or absence of specific entities (characters) across both provided images.
11. Completeness in multimodal set operations -> Whether the answer includes all items that satisfy the logical condition (intersection of characters) described in the question.
12. Factual accuracy in multi-entity identification -> Whether the list of entities provided in the answer is factually correct and free from hallucinations or omissions.

Representative hard cases (up to 3):
- sample 17: difficulty=4.11, confidence=0.53; scores[weak: c=9.0, t=8.5; normal: c=7.5, t=9.0; sota: c=2.0, t=2.5]

Suggested agent types (you may adjust/improve):
- data_filter_agent: 给出基于指标的保留/剔除建议，关注高频/general指标
- edge_case_agent: 结合难例，总结风险模式与需要人工复核的情形
- consistency_agent: 检查模型分歧点，对分歧大的样本给出额外检查标准
- prompt_designer: 为上述agents生成精炼的执行prompt
